## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Minglr locally using XAMPP:

1. Install XAMPP:

   - Click on the "Config" button next to Apache and select "Apache (httpd.conf)".
   - In the `httpd.conf` file, search for the line `DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"` and make sure it points to the correct directory where your web files will be located.
   - Save the changes and restart the Apache service.

3. Clone the GitHub repository:
   - Open the terminal or command prompt.
   - Change the directory to the XAMPP `htdocs` folder:
     ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/Mayuresh-22/Minglr-Social-Network-Site.git
   ```

5. Configure the Database:

6. Configure Site Settings:

7. Start the Development Server:
